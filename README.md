# Notes

This repo contains notes, expository articles and beamer presentations on various topics.

## Talk slides

1. ___'PANTS XXVII/': PANTS XXVI presentation___

    Those are the slides of the beamer presentation I gave at the [Palmeto Number Theory Series](https://www.uncg.edu/mat/numbertheory/conferences/PANTS-XXVI.html "PANTS XXVI") meeting on September 17th, 2016. The presentation was about the Petersson inner product of binary theta series. See the notes below for more details on this topic.

## Notes/expository articles
1. ___'Iwasawa Theory/': Notes on Iwasawa's construction of the p-adic zeta function of Q, following Coates and Sujata___

    These notes were prepared for a graduate student seminar at McGill University on Iwasawa Theory for cyclotomic fields. They can be seen as a review of the construction of the p-adic zeta function as presented in Coates and Sujata's book "Cyclotomic Fields and Zeta Values".

2. ___'Theta Norm/': Petersson inner product of binary theta Series (In progress)___

    In these notes, we find formulas for the Petersson inner product of binary theta series attached to imaginary quadratic fields. The formulas were explicit enough to be implemented, leading to the algorithms in the ENT/theta/ repo. The notes contain many numerical examples, including numerical computations of special values of Hecke L-functions attached to Hecke characters of imaginary quadratic fields at certain critical points. These notes are related to a project which is still in progress, so they may contain typos and the notation might change in subsequent versions.

3. ___'Theta Series/': Notes on the classical theory of theta series___

    Written for a presentation at the *Galois Representations Seminar* at McGill University in Fall 2015 (the other participant's notes are available [here](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/goren/GS/GraduateSeminar.html "Other participant's notes")). This is an introduction to the "classical" theory of theta series.

4. ___'Arithmetic Manifolds/': Notes on arithmetic manifolds___

    Written for a presentation at the Galois Representations Seminar at McGill University in Fall 2015 (the other participant's notes are available [here](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/goren/GS/GraduateSeminar.html "Other participant's notes")). This is an introduction to some of Scholze's results of Galois representations.

5. ___'Tchebotarev Theorem/': Notes on Tchebotarev's Theorem___

    Those note were written for an analytic number theory course. The goal is to give an almost self-contained proof of Tchebotarev's density theorem.

6. ___'Galois Infinie/': Notes on infinite Galois theory___

    Prepared for the *Séminaire de Géométrie et d'Algèbre* at the University of Montreal during Summer 2013. The goal is to give an introduction to direct and inverse limits and infinite Galois theory. **Those notes are in French**.
